CANFD-based Body Control Module with UDS Diagnostics - Automotive Embedded System
# Body Control Module with OBD Support (UDS) - Automotive Embedded System

This project aims to design and simulate a **Body Control Module (BCM)** using **CANFD communication** and **UDS (ISO 14229) diagnostic services** for vehicle body functions and fault monitoring.

## Project Overview

The BCM is a critical component in automotive embedded systems responsible for managing non-engine-related functions such as:
- Lighting systems
- Door locks
- Wipers
- Mirror adjustments

The project supports **real-time diagnostics** through UDS and **external interface via OBD-II**.

## Features

- **CANFD-based communication** for high-speed data transfer.
- **UDS protocol** for diagnostics and fault detection.
- **STM32 firmware development** using STM32CubeIDE.
- Modular design with focus on automotive industry standards.

## Technologies Used

### Microcontroller & Hardware
- STM32F4 Development Board
- CAN Transceiver (MCP2562)
- Sensors & Actuators

### Software Tools
- STM32CubeIDE – Firmware Development
- GitHub – Version Control
- Notion – Documentation

### Communication Protocols
- CANFD – High-speed in-vehicle communication
- UDS (ISO 14229) – Diagnostic services
- OBD-II – External diagnostics interface

## Project Status

- **Current Phase**: Initial Planning & Requirements Gathering
- **Next Steps**: STM32 Configuration and UDS service implementation
